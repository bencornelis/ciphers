### Ciphers

* Caesar - each letter is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet [(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
* Vigen√®re - uses a series of Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword [(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)
* Deranged/Mixed Alphabet - substitutes the alphabet for a scrambled alphabet. The deranged alphabet is obtained by first writing out a keyword, then all the remaining letters in alphabetical order [(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher)
